## 🎉 UI Features
The React App has the following functionalities:
- 🌎A home page that has Navbar to allow for users to easily navigate the webpage.
- 🚀Sponsors and inbound guardians can register a new account and select their role.
- 📬 Once a sponsor is logged in, they can see a list of inbound guardians attached to them to get their contact information.
- 🧾 Once an inbound guardian is logged in, they can see a list of their tasks and their sponsor's contact information.
- ✏ An administrator can log in to assign inbound guardians to a sponsor.
- 📑 Sponsors and adminstrators can add tasks to an inbound guardian's checklist.

## 🏞 Background
This project was designed with the intent of replacing the paper in-processing checklists. This website allows for a central location for sponsors and inbound guardians to easily get contact information for each other and to see required tasks for upcoming PCS moves.

### 🤓 Database Requirements
Embark uses a PostgreSQL docker container. Tables are created programaticly, but you will have to create the database throught the psql CLI.
1. Pull the PostgreSQL docker container.

    ``` docker pull postgres ```

2. Create volume, turn on container, log into container
    1.  ```mkdir -p $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres```

    2.  ```docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres```

    3. ```docker ps -a```

    4. Copy the container ID from the output

    5. ``` docker exec -it <PSQL-Container-ID> bash ```
3. Create a DB called " zork_db "

    ```dbcreate -U postgres zork_db```

##  🚀 Database Schema
This was made with PostgreSQL DB to persist user data, maintain tasks, and provide relations between users and tasks.
